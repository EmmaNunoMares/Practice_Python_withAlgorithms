FIBONACCI
the fibonacci sequence is defined as follow: the first number of the sequence is 0,
the second number is 1, and the nth number is the sum of the (n-1)th and (n-2)th numbers.
write a function that takes in an integer n and returns the nth fibonacci number.

important note: the fibonacci sequence is often defined with its two numbers as F0=0 and F1=1.
For the purpose of this question, the first fibonacci number is F0; therefore, getNthFib(1)
is equal to F0, getNthFib(2) is equal to F1, etc...
Example 1
Input: 
n=2
Output:
1// 0,1
Example 2
Input: 
n=6
Output:
5// 0,1,1,2,3,5
